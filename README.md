# JiraTicket

🧰 Help Desk Ticket Resolution Project (Jira)
This project demonstrates my ability to work with a ticketing system (Jira) to resolve common help desk tasks involving Active Directory user account management. The project includes two realistic tickets: one for unlocking a user account and one for disabling a user account as part of an offboarding process.

These tasks reflect typical Tier 1/Tier 2 responsibilities in IT support environments.

📌 Project Overview
In this lab, I used Jira to simulate a help desk workflow. I created, triaged, and resolved two tickets:

Unlock a locked Active Directory account

Disable an Active Directory account for a terminated employee

Each ticket includes:

Issue summary

Troubleshooting steps

Resolution notes

Status transitions

Professional communication via Jira comments

This project demonstrates my ability to follow IT support processes and document work clearly.
